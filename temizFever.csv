consequently co levels at around to ppm were actually low enough to promote glaciation in the southern continent of gondwana,SUPPORTS
since rock weathering reduces atmospheric co this again reinforces the scientific fact that co is a strong driver of climate,NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
clearly other factors besides atmospheric carbon influence earth temperatures and global warming,SUPPORTS
hocker is claiming that his model shows that the longterm upward trend in co is explained by temperature when his methods actually removed the longterm trend,SUPPORTS
thousands of coral atolls have drowned in the past when they were unable to grow fast enough to maintain a presence at sea level,SUPPORTS
there are many lines of evidence which clearly show that the atmospheric co increase is caused by humans,SUPPORTS
the clearest of these is simple accounting humans are emitting co at a rate twice as fast as the atmospheric increase natural sinks are absorbing the other half,SUPPORTS
there is no question whatsoever that the co increase is humancaused,SUPPORTS
that atmospheric co increase that we observe is a product of temperature increase and not the other way around meaning it is a product of natural variation,REFUTES
once natural influences in particular the impact of el niño and la niña are removed from the recent termperature record there is no evidence of a significant change in the human contribution to climate change,DISPUTED
there has been no increase in the global average surface temperature for the past years judith curry and david rose,REFUTES
the observed data show that cfcs conspiring with cosmic rays most likely caused both the antarctic ozone hole and global warming,DISPUTED
correspondingly the global surface temperature has also dropped,DISPUTED
models and direct observations find that cfcs only contribute a fraction of the warming supplied by other greenhouse gases,NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
this increases confidence in other peerreviewed research predicting sea level rise of cm to metres by,SUPPORTS
another global warming myth comes crashing down,NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
no warming since at least no melting glaciers and now no rising sea levels,REFUTES
the claim that conventional jobs are destroyed for every new job created in the alternative energy industry is based on a study which relies on incorrect numbers cherrypicked dates faulty theory flawed methodology and is disproven by realworld examples,SUPPORTS
for every renewable energy job that the state manages to finance spain’s experiencereveals with high confidence by two different methods that the us should expect a loss of at least jobs on average,NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
continued greenhouse gas emissions at or above current rates would cause further warming and induce many changes in the global climate system during the st century that would very likely be larger than those observed during the th century,SUPPORTS
so this is a government which is proposing to put at risk our manufacturing industry to penalise struggling families to make a tough situation worse for millions of households right around australia,NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
a paperin science magazine concludes that the climate sensitivity—how much the earth’s average temperature will rise as a result of a doubling of the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide—likely that is with a probability lies in the range °c to °c with a median value of °c,DISPUTED
fourth assessment report ar in which the likely range is given as °c to °c with a best estimate of °c pat michaels,SUPPORTS
multiple lines of evidence indicate greenlands ice loss is accelerating and will contribute sea level rise in the order of metres over the next few centuries,SUPPORTS

however a single scientist dr ben santer of lawrence livermore national laboratory rewrote the draft at the ipcc’s request deleting all five statements replacing them with a single statement to the effect that a human influence on global climate was now discernible and making some consequential amendments,NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
the temperature increase in the second half of the th century could have taken place in steps driven by major enso events jens raunsø jensen,DISPUTED
a generous estimate of the energy generated by satellites is around million times too small to cause global warming,NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
global warming history completely coincides with the history of artificial satellites and the use of microwave frequencies from outer space,NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
sending oscillating microwaves from an antenna inside a vacuum through an electromagnetic field through a dielectric material such as water creates radio frequency heating at the molecular level,SUPPORTS
the ipcc’s fourth assessment report carries in three places a graph in which the hadley center’s global mean surface temperature anomaly dataset from is displayed with four arbitrarilychosen trendlines overlaid upon it,SUPPORTS
there is anecdotal and other evidence suggesting similar melts from and on other occasions,NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
disasters cost more than ever — but not because of climate change roger pielke jr,REFUTES
the satellite sensors show less warming in the lower troposphere approximately feet above the earth’s surface than is reported by surface temperature readings,SUPPORTS
global warming theory holds that one of the fingerprints of humaninduced global warming is more rapid warming in the lower troposphere than at the surface james taylor,NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
in those days you couldn’t have seen across the street for all the carbon emissions and the crap coming out of the chimneys,NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
ljungqvists millennial temperature reconstruction was very similar to moberg et al,NOT_ENOUGH_INFO

what i can comment on is this prediction by dr hansen “the west side highway which runs along the hudson river will be under water”,NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
co constitutes of the noncondensing greenhouse gas forcing,REFUTES
cloud cover in models is poorly treated and inaccurately predicted,SUPPORTS
yet clouds reflect about seventyfive watts per square meter,NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
given that a doubling of carbon dioxide would change the surface heat flux by only two watts per square meter it is evident that a small change in cloud cover can strongly affect the response to carbon dioxide,SUPPORTS

about of the warming observed from to was very likely caused by this natural year climatic cycle during its warming phase,NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
skeptics hope that postma’s alternative thermal model will lead to the birth of a new climatology one that actually follows the laws of physics and properly physical modeling techniques,NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
there are other possible causes for climate change which could be associated with solar activity or related to variations in the temperature of the liquid core of the earth which is about degrees celsius,SUPPORTS
we dont need a high heat flow just a high temperature for the core to affect the surface climate,NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
over the last decade heatwaves are five times more likely than if there had been no global warming,SUPPORTS
